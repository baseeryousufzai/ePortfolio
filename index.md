- A polemount transformer (TX), an integral component in the process of electricity distribution. Electricity from substations is stepped futhermore by these, usually to 1 phase (PH) AC power. You can usually find these securely hanging on the side of wooden power poles! They usually weigh at least a few hundred pounds from all of the oil they contain (50 L), and other heavy components inside them.

## Hello and welcome to my ePortfolio!

Hi there! My name is Baseer Yousufzai and I’m a 3rd-year electrical engineering student
at the Lassonde School of Engineering. I’m an eager and passionate individual that dedicates
myself to any task or organization I come across. Please click [here](https://streamable.com/nt2qqg) to learn a little more about me.

## Education
- Lassonde School of Engineering, Electrical Engineering B.Eng 2023, 3.0/4.0 GPA

## Work Experience 
**1. Kumon Canada - Grading Table Lead** - _August 2015-June 2018_
   - Grading student work and supervising coworkers during classroom hours.
   - Co-produced and presented two training modules to staff about grading policies and in-class protocols to reduce mistakes made during in-class grading.
  
**2. Research at York (RAY) - Engineering Education Research Assistant** - _July 2020-September 2020_
    - Developed an Excel sheet on threshold and mathematical concepts related to 1st and 2nd year in the engineering curricula at York University, for instructor use.
    - Conducted literature review on concepts related to engineering education (i.e. Lateral thinking, transformative topics, etc).

**3. Alectra Utilities - Distribution Standards Engineering Assistant** - _December 2020-April 2022_
    - Assist the Standards Engineer with the development, updating, obtaining approvals and distribution of standards in accordance with Ontario Regulation 22/04, all applicable       laws, codes and regulation to maximize the earned value for all assets and minimize risk exposure to the public and employees.
    - Assist the Standards Engineer in the approval process for equipment/material to be used in Alectra systems, based on test reports/drawings/technical data/quality records.
    - Assist in maintaining all department files record for Ontario Regulation 22/04 purposes and for other legal and regulatory requirements.

## Goals
- To continue working in the power and electricity distribution industry. Because electricity is a valuable asset to learn, grow, and live with, I'd like to work towards providing all with a stable source electricity.
- Contribute towards the goal of sustainable energy for residential use. For example, in electrical equipment, SF6 gas is used as a dielectric to put out any dangerous sparks made while in use. However, it's very environmentally unfriendly given it contributes to the greenhouse effect and takes a very long time to break down. My goal is to research and develop a sustainable subsitute for SF6 gas.
- Be a positive role model for Afghan youth and other minorities interested in STEM as a possible career path. This hits home to me as a visible minority. When growing up, I didn't know a lot about STEM careers and didn't have any mentors to gain advice from. My parents worked hard, immigrating to Canada didn't have the time to raise me on such matters so I was left, mostly on my own. Although I'm happy where I am now, I'd like to make this process easier for others and encourage them to do better than how I had it.

## Projects

- In this hodge podge of projects, I've built several interactable displays for a few in school events for kids to interact with and learn the concept behind. 

     - The robot car is controlled with an Arduino Nano graciously donated by Elegoo (product tester role) that uses its onboard, infrared sensors to avoid bumping or falling off obstacles when approaching them. 

     - The colored breadboards are connected to a wheel you can spin to light up the connected LEDs. This is called a dynamo, whereas you use mechanical energy to convert it to electrical potential energy. I've also configured the wiring to show what happens when the LEDs are connected in series, parallel, and a bit of both.

     - The circuit in the middle uses a 74HC595 shift register IC chip to store 1's and 0's that are represented by LEDs (on or off).

     - The breadboard on the bottom has a sound sensor connected to an LM3914 IC chip and LEDs that light up the more sound it detects. Although this IC chip is traditionally used to drive an LED bar light, it works very well as a sensor output.

- Here I used an ESP32 microcontroller to make my first IoT project, a smart lamp - a web-controlled circuit that uses 6 RGB LEDs to simulate nearly any color the user wishes.

## Skills
- Using electronic lab equipment (oscilloscope, function generator, etc).
- Building, prototyping, and testing electric circuits.
- Labvolt (electrical motor simulation software).
- Intermediate knowledge in Java, Python, MS Office, and MATLAB.

## Hobbies
- Learning more about embedded systems!
       - As of now, I've ordered several development boards to get started on. One of which I'm very excited to start is with the DM164144 - Curiosity Nano board which uses a PIC16F18446 as the microcontroller. For context, a PIC chip is a microcontroller that was developed in the 80's that's still widely used as they're dirt cheap, optimal for embedded systems (e.g. You don't need a washing machine that operates at a high clock rate), and have a lot of resources out there to use. I'm excited to get this as without a development board, programming a PIC chip requires an $80 (CAD) +, programmer kit to do - this board costs just $15 CAD! Also, I'd like to learn embedded C which this board uses.

## Self-Reflection
- As a budding engineering major, there's no question I have a lot to learn. At my current internship with Alectra Utilities, I'm being introduced into the power industry and I love every moment of it. I want to learn as much as I can about electricity distribution across Ontario and I'm grateful that Alectra is one of the best companies to learn at. However, I must continue putting in the effort to learn as a lot of the content is things I've seen in a school setting. I will also continue to enhance my technical skills and want to have some impactful projects under my belt by the time my internship ends in April 2022.
