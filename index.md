## Hello and welcome to my website!

Hi there! My name is Baseer Yousufzai and I’m a 3rd-year electrical engineering student
at the Lassonde School of Engineering. I’m an eager and passionate individual and I dedicate
myself to any task or organization I come across. I’m a first-generation Afghan-Canadian who
has faced many challenges and struggles but is still here today. I’m here to honor those who
have given so much for me and inspire my people and the youth in this country. One example of
which is my uncle, Wali Mohammed Yousufzai, a father figure, mentor, and best friend to me.
He passed away as of last year and he’s taught me countless things that wouldn’t make me the
same person I would be today without him. One key point, in particular, is that hard work always
pays off. No matter how long and challenging engineering is, there’s always a light at the end of
the tunnel that’s only achievable via hard work, determination, and grit.

I’m studying electrical engineering as I have a strong interest in many paths within this major
such as power electronics, electricity distribution, and electrical circuits and their many
applications. I always try to learn and apply the content from my engineering courses to real-life
applications as I know that’s how I’ll truly learn and understand the course material while having
a better appreciation for how they function. I’ve chosen to attend York University as I feel it has
a strong electronics and power engineering concentration within my branch of electrical
engineering. In addition to this, it’s extremely close to my home and by far the most affordable
option for my education (as I’d be mostly paying for it by myself). However, it’s not where you
go, it’s what you do there that truly matters
