## Hello and welcome to my ePortfolio!

Hi there! My name is Baseer Yousufzai and I’m a 3rd-year electrical engineering student
at the Lassonde School of Engineering. I’m an eager and passionate individual and I dedicate
myself to any task or organization I come across. 

I’m studying electrical engineering as I have a strong interest in many paths within this major
such as power electronics, electricity distribution, and electrical circuits and their many
applications. I always try to learn and apply the content from my engineering courses to real-life
applications as I know that’s how I’ll truly learn and understand the course material while having
a better appreciation for how they function.
